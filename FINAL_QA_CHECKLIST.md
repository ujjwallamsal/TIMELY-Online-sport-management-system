**Date**: October 1, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ ALL FIXES COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING

---

## ✅ All Implementation Tasks Completed

### 1. Auth Provider ✅
- **Issue**: "useAuth must be used within an AuthProvider" errors
- **Fix**: Removed duplicate `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`, consolidated to single `auth/AuthProvider`
- **Test**: Login/logout works across all pages, no console errors

### 2. Role-Based Navigation ✅
- **Issue**: Navigation showing wrong items for each role
- **Fix**: Updated `config/navigation.ts` with correct role filtering
- **Test**: 
  - Spectator sees: Home, Events, News, Gallery, My Tickets, Notifications, Profile, Upgrade Role
  - Athlete adds: Schedule, My Registrations, Results
  - Coach adds: Teams, Approvals
  - Organizer sees: Event Management, Registrations Review, Announcements, Venues, Fixtures

### 3. Notification Details ✅
- **Issue**: Notifications just listed, no detail view
- **Fix**: Created `NotificationDrawer` component with deep-links
- **Test**: Click notification → drawer opens → click deep-link button → navigates correctly

### 4. News Detail ✅
- **Issue**: "Read full article" CTA not working
- **Fix**: Verified routing works correctly (already implemented)
- **Test**: Click news card → detail page opens → content displays

### 5. Gallery Upload ✅
- **Issue**: No visibility controls
- **Fix**: Upload modal includes Public/Private dropdown (already implemented)
- **Test**: Upload image → set to Public → verify appears in "All Media (Public)" for other users

### 6. Stripe Checkout ✅
- **Issue**: "Unsupported payment flow" error
- **Fix**: Backend creates Checkout Session, frontend redirects with sessionId
- **Test**: Buy ticket → Stripe Checkout opens → complete payment → ticket appears in My Tickets

### 7. Schedule Page ✅
- **Issue**: Missing page
- **Fix**: Created `/schedule` page showing approved registrations
- **Test**: Athlete registers → organizer approves → schedule updates within 15s

### 8. Teams Page ✅
- **Issue**: Missing page
- **Fix**: Created `/teams` page for coaches
- **Test**: Coach sees teams and members (or empty state if backend not configured)

### 9. Approvals Page ✅
- **Issue**: Missing page
- **Fix**: Created `/approvals` page for coach/organizer
- **Test**: View pending registrations → approve/reject → athlete notified + schedule updated

### 10. Announcements Page ✅
- **Issue**: Missing page
- **Fix**: Created `/announcements` page for organizer
- **Test**: Create announcement → select audience → athletes receive notification

### 11. Role Upgrade Flow ✅
- **Issue**: Applications not submitting correctly
- **Fix**: Enhanced with validation, success notifications, and error handling
- **Test**: Submit application → see success message → admin approves in Django → navbar updates within 15-30s

### 12. Registration Flow ✅
- **Issue**: Need full registration → payment → approval → schedule flow
- **Fix**: All components already wired correctly
- **Test**: 
  - Paid event: Register → Stripe Checkout → Pending → Approve → Schedule
  - Free event: Register → Pending → Approve → Schedule
