# Test Evidence - Automated Verification

## Database Analysis - Proof of Idempotency Issue

**Date**: October 1, 2025

### CRITICAL: Duplicate Orders Found

Query Results:
```
⚠️  Found 3 payment intents used multiple times!
  Payment Intent: mock_session_42_43 used 28 times
  Payment Intent: mock_intent_45_45 used 7 times
  Payment Intent: mock_session_45_43 used 4 times
```

**Analysis**:
- **39 duplicate orders** identified (28 + 7 + 4 = 39)
- Only **2 unique valid orders** (41 total - 39 duplicates)
- **95% of orders are duplicates!**

**Root Cause**: No idempotency keys in checkout flow

### Order Status Distribution

```
Status Distribution:
  PENDING: 39 orders (95%)
  paid: 1 order (2.4%)
  pending: 1 order (2.4%)
```

**Analysis**:
- 39 orders stuck in PENDING (likely duplicates)
- Only 1 successfully paid order
- Inconsistent status capitalization (PENDING vs pending)

### Payment Intent Coverage

```
Total Orders: 41
With Payment Intent: 41 (100%)
Without Payment Intent: 0 (0%)
```

**Analysis**:
- All orders have payment intents (good)
- But many share the same payment intent (BAD)
- Proves idempotency is critical issue

## Code Analysis Evidence

### 1. Idempotency Keys: NOT FOUND
```bash
$ grep -rn "idempotency" payments/stripe_gateway.py
# No matches found
```

### 2. Database Locking: NOT FOUND
```bash
$ grep -rn "select_for_update" tickets/ events/
# No matches found
```

### 3. EXIF Stripping: NOT FOUND
```bash
$ grep -rn "exif\|EXIF" mediahub/services/
# No matches found
```

### 4. Unique Constraints: MISSING
```sql
SELECT constraint_name, constraint_type 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints 
WHERE table_name='tickets_ticketorder' AND constraint_type='UNIQUE';
-- Result: [] (empty)
```

## System Health Check

### ✅ Healthy Components
- Django configuration: No errors
- Database migrations: All applied
- Model structure: Correct
- Basic API endpoints: Functional

### ❌ Critical Issues
- Idempotency: Not implemented → 39 duplicate orders exist
- Race conditions: No locking → overselling risk
- Privacy: No EXIF stripping → data leak risk
- Data integrity: No unique constraints → duplicate risk

---

## Recommendations

### URGENT (Cannot Launch Without)
1. Fix idempotency (prevents 95% of current duplicates)
2. Add database locking (prevents overselling)
3. Implement EXIF stripping (prevents privacy violations)

### HIGH Priority
4. Clean up duplicate orders in database
5. Add unique constraints on payment_intent_id
6. Standardize order status (PENDING vs pending)
