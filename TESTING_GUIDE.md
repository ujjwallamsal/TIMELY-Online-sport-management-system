## üêõ Common Issues & Fixes

### Issue: 404 on notifications/unread-count/
**Fix:** Ensure using underscore: `/api/notifications/unread_count/`

### Issue: Gallery upload returns 405
**Fix:** Ensure multipart/form-data header and correct field names

### Issue: Profile re-renders infinitely
**Fix:** Already fixed - if still occurs, clear browser cache

### Issue: Free ticket returns 400 "Not a free event"
**Fix:** Ensure event.fee_cents is exactly 0 in database

### Issue: Login doesn't redirect back
**Fix:** Ensure using `returnTo` query param, not `next`
