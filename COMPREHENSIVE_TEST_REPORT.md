## Configuration Notes

### Environment Variables Required

**Frontend** (`.env` in `timely-frontend/`):
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
```

**Backend** (`.env` in `timely-backend/`):
```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
DB_NAME=timely_db
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=5432
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### Stripe Configuration

- Stripe keys must be test keys (`pk_test_` and `sk_test_`)
- Checkout success URL: `http://localhost:5173/events/{id}?success=1`
- Checkout cancel URL: `http://localhost:5173/events/{id}?canceled=1`
- Webhook endpoint: `http://localhost:8000/api/tickets/webhook/`

---

## Recommendations for Production

1. **Enable HTTPS**: Set `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT=True` and use production Stripe keys
2. **Configure CORS**: Restrict `CORS_ALLOW_ALL_ORIGINS` to specific domains
3. **Enable Redis**: For production-grade WebSocket support
4. **Rate Limiting**: Already configured, verify throttle rates for production load
5. **Monitoring**: Add error tracking (Sentry) and performance monitoring
6. **Email**: Configure SMTP settings for production email notifications

---

## Conclusion

All existing functionality has been thoroughly tested and verified to work correctly. The three critical fixes ensure proper checkout flow, eliminate potential re-render loops, and improve error handling. The system successfully:

- ✅ Persists all data to Django backend
- ✅ Updates UI in real-time or near real-time
- ✅ Handles errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
