# Profile Fixes Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Role Application Endpoints Missing

**Problem:** Frontend was calling `/auth/apply-athlete/`, `/auth/apply-coach/`, and `/auth/apply-organizer/` endpoints that didn't exist in the backend.

**Solution:** Added three new API endpoints in `accounts/views.py` and registered them in `accounts/urls.py`:

- `POST /api/auth/apply-athlete/` - Apply for athlete role
- `POST /api/auth/apply-coach/` - Apply for coach role  
- `POST /api/auth/apply-organizer/` - Apply for organizer role
- `GET /api/auth/applications/` - Get user's applications

**Features:**
- Prevents duplicate pending applications
- Uses proper serializers for validation
- Returns application ID on success
- Proper error handling

### 2. âœ… Profile Save Functionality

**Status:** Already working correctly!

The profile save functionality was already properly implemented:
- Uses `useForm` hook with proper validation
- Calls `PATCH /api/me` to update profile
- Shows success/error messages
- Refetches user data after update
- Properly toggles edit mode

### 3. âœ… Password Change Functionality

**Status:** Already working correctly!

The password change feature was already properly implemented:
- Validates password strength
- Confirms new password matches
- Uses correct endpoint: `POST /api/users/:id/change-password/`
- Shows/hides password fields
- Clears form on success

## Files Modified

### Backend
- `/timely-backend/accounts/urls.py` - Added role application endpoints
- `/timely-backend/accounts/views.py` - Added role application view functions

### Frontend  
- No changes needed - Profile component was already correct!

## Architecture

### Role Application Flow

1. **User submits application** â†’ Frontend calls `/api/auth/apply-{role}/`
2. **Backend validates** â†’ Checks for existing pending applications
3. **Creates application** â†’ Saves to database with PENDING status
4. **Returns success** â†’ Frontend shows confirmation
5. **Admin reviews** â†’ Uses approval workflow to approve/reject
6. **User gets role** â†’ Role is assigned on approval

### Profile Update Flow

1. **User edits profile** â†’ Frontend enables edit mode
2. **User saves changes** â†’ Frontend calls `PATCH /api/me`
3. **Backend updates** â†’ Saves changes to database
4. **Refetch user** â†’ Frontend reloads user data
5. **Exit edit mode** â†’ Form returns to view mode

## Notes

- All endpoints require authentication
- Role applications prevent duplicates (one pending application per role)
- Profile updates use PATCH for partial updates
- Password changes require current password for security
- All changes are properly validated on backend
