# Navigation Implementation Complete ✓

## Overview
Implemented a comprehensive, role-based navigation system for the Organizer role with dropdowns, real-time badge counts, responsive design, and full accessibility support.

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### 1. **Pending Count Hooks** (`src/hooks/usePendingCounts.ts`)
- Created `usePendingRegistrationsCount()` hook
- Created `usePendingApprovalsCount()` hook
- Both hooks:
  - Fetch counts from existing endpoints
  - Gracefully return 0 on error (never break nav)
  - Auto-refresh every 15 seconds for real-time updates
  - Use 30-second stale time for performance

### 2. **Navigation Configuration** (`src/config/navigation.ts`)
- Added `getNavigationByRole()` function for role-specific navigation
- **Organizer Navigation Structure:**
  - Dashboard → `/dashboard`
  - Events (dropdown):
    - Browse Events → `/events`
    - My Events → `/events/mine`
    - Create Event → `/events/create`
  - Management (dropdown):
    - Fixtures → `/fixtures`
    - Results → `/results`
    - Venues → `/venues`
    - Announcements → `/announcements`
  - Registrations (dropdown):
    - Registrations Review → `/registrations` (with badge)
    - Approvals → `/approvals` (with badge)
- Added `badgeKey` property to `NavItem` interface for badge support
- Made `to` property optional for parent dropdown items

### 3. **Dropdown Component** (`src/components/NavDropdown.tsx`)
- Reusable navigation dropdown with:
  - Click to open/close
  - Hover state for better UX
  - Badge support for pending counts
  - Active route highlighting
  - Click-outside to close
  - Escape key to close
  - Full keyboard navigation (Tab/Shift+Tab)
  - `aria-expanded` and `aria-haspopup` attributes
  - Focus trap when open
  - Auto-close on navigation

### 4. **Main Navbar Component** (`src/components/Navbar.tsx`)
Complete refactor with:

#### Left Section:
- Timely logo (links to `/`)
- Primary navigation with dropdowns (Desktop only at ≥1024px)

#### Right Section:
- Search icon (placeholder for future)
- Notifications bell with:
  - Unread count badge
  - Dropdown preview (5 most recent)
  - Mark all as read
  - Link to full notifications page
  - Real-time updates
- My Tickets icon (accessible to all authenticated users)
- User menu dropdown with:
  - User name and role display
  - Profile → `/profile`
  - Account Settings → `/settings`
  - Sign Out

#### Features:
- **Sticky header** with elevation shadow on scroll
- **Loading state**: Minimal nav skeleton while auth loads
- **Real-time badge updates**: Every 15 seconds
- **Responsive breakpoints**:
  - ≥1280px: Full nav as designed
  - ≥1024px: Desktop nav with all features
  - <1024px: Hamburger menu with slide-in mobile nav

#### Mobile Menu (<1024px):
- Hamburger icon in top-right
- Slide-in navigation panel with:
  - All navigation items grouped by section
  - Section headers for dropdowns
  - Nested items indented
  - Badge counts visible
  - My Tickets link
  - Profile & Settings links
  - Auto-close on navigation

#### Accessibility:
- All buttons have `aria-label` attributes
- Dropdowns have `aria-expanded` and `role="menu"`
- Keyboard navigation fully supported
- Focus states visible
- Screen reader friendly structure

### 5. **Routes Added** (`src/app/routes.tsx`)
Added missing routes:
- `/events/mine` → Shows events created by current user (Organizer/Admin only)
- `/settings` → Account settings (currently redirects to Profile)

### 6. **Events List Enhancement** (`src/features/events/List.tsx`)
- Added support for `/events/mine` route
- Uses `useAuth()` to get current user
- Conditionally queries either:
  - `usePublicEvents()` for `/events` (all public events)
  - `useEvents()` with `created_by` filter for `/events/mine` (user's events only)
- Updates page title and description based on route

## 🎨 Visual & Interaction Polish

### Completed:
✅ Sticky header with subtle shadow on scroll
✅ Compact spacing (no wrapping at 1280px)
✅ Active route indication (blue background + text)
✅ Dropdowns open on click
✅ Badge counts display on:
  - Notifications (unread)
  - Registrations Review (pending)
  - Approvals (pending)
✅ Create Event discoverable in Events dropdown
✅ Prominent visual hierarchy

### Design Consistency:
- Uses existing Tailwind utility classes
- Maintains current color scheme (blue-600 primary)
- Consistent spacing and typography
- No new global design tokens added

## 📱 Responsive Behavior

### Desktop (≥1280px):
- Full navigation fits on one line
- All dropdowns visible and functional
- Badge counts inline

### Tablet (≥1024px, <1280px):
- Full navigation still visible
- Dropdowns work as expected

### Mobile (<1024px):
- Logo visible
- Search, notifications, user avatar visible
- Hamburger menu for navigation
- Slide-in panel with:
  - Grouped navigation items
  - Section headers
  - Badge counts
  - Profile & settings

## 🔒 Role & Permission Rules

### Organizer/Admin:
- See full navigation as specified
- Access to Management and Registrations sections
- Can create events
- Can view pending counts

### Coach:
- Dashboard, Events, Teams, Schedule
- Approvals (with badge)

### Athlete:
- Dashboard, Events, Schedule
- My Registrations, Results

### Spectator:
- Home, Events, News, Gallery
- Upgrade Role option

### Not Authenticated:
- Home, Events, News, Gallery (public nav)
- Sign In / Sign Up buttons

## 📊 Data & Real-Time

### Badge Counts:
- **Source**: Existing API endpoints
- **Update frequency**: Every 15 seconds (polling)
- **Error handling**: Returns 0 if endpoint fails (no nav break)
- **Quiet logging**: Errors logged to console only

### Queries Used:
- `useGetUnreadNotificationsCount()` - Already existed
- `usePendingRegistrationsCount()` - New hook
- `usePendingApprovalsCount()` - New hook

### Real-time Mechanism:
- React Query with `refetchInterval: 15000`
- Automatic cache invalidation on actions
- No SSE/WebSocket needed for nav (uses polling)

## 📂 Files Created/Modified

### Created:
1. `src/hooks/usePendingCounts.ts` - Badge count hooks
2. `src/components/NavDropdown.tsx` - Reusable dropdown component
3. `NAVIGATION_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md` - This document

### Modified:
1. `src/config/navigation.ts` - Added role-based navigation
2. `src/components/Navbar.tsx` - Complete refactor
3. `src/app/routes.tsx` - Added /events/mine and /settings routes

## 🚀 Usage

### For Organizers:

2. Navigation automatically shows Organizer-specific layout
3. Badge counts update automatically every 15 seconds
4. Use dropdowns to navigate to different sections
5. Click "My Events" to see only your created events

### For Developers:
```typescript
// Badge counts automatically fetched
const { data: pendingRegs = 0 } = usePendingRegistrationsCount(isOrganizer);

// Navigation based on role
const navItems = getNavigationByRole(user?.role, isAuthenticated);

// Dropdown component usage
<NavDropdown item={navItem} badges={badgeObject} />
```

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Status

### From Requirements:
✅ Desktop nav fits on one line (no wrapping) at 1280px
✅ Mobile hamburger contains the same items, grouped exactly as specified
✅ "Create Event" is discoverable within Events
✅ Badges: unread notifications, pending registrations, pending approvals update within 15s and never break the nav
✅ Keyboard navigation and screen reader flow pass basic WCAG checks
✅ Route guards confirmed: direct URL access respects permissions
✅ No console errors or React re-render loops caused by the nav

### Additional Quality Checks:
✅ Visual style consistent with existing design
✅ No new global design tokens added
✅ Component props can be refactored but styling preserved
✅ Error handling graceful (no broken UI)
✅ Performance optimized (stale time, smart refetching)

## 🔄 Future Enhancements

### Not Implemented (Out of Scope):
- Search functionality (icon placeholder added)

## 📝 Notes

- All badge counts use existing endpoints - no new APIs required
- Dropdown components are reusable for future navigation needs
- Mobile menu structure matches desktop exactly (same grouping)
- Role-based navigation is centralized in config file
- No breaking changes to existing routes or components
- Backward compatible with existing navigation usage

## 🐛 Known Issues
None. All acceptance criteria met.
