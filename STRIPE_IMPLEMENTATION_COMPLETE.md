# ✅ Real Stripe Checkout Implementation - COMPLETE

## 🎉 Implementation Summary

Successfully integrated **real Stripe checkout** with admin approval workflow for the TIMELY sports management system.

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### Backend (Django/DRF)

1. **Updated Models** (`tickets/models.py`)
   - Added approval workflow statuses: `PENDING_APPROVAL`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`
   - Added order statuses: `PAYMENT_PENDING`, `PAID`, `FREE`, `FAILED`
   - Added approval tracking: `approved_by`, `approved_at`
   - Added `client_reference_id` for Stripe session matching

2. **Checkout Endpoint** (`tickets/views_checkout.py`)
   - `POST /api/tickets/checkout/` - Creates Stripe Checkout Sessions
   - Handles paid events → Stripe redirect
   - Handles free events → Direct approval flow
   - Creates orders with `payment_pending` status
   - Returns `{sessionId, checkoutUrl, publicKey}`

3. **Free Ticket Endpoint** (`tickets/views_checkout.py`)
   - `POST /api/tickets/free/` - For free events
   - Creates order with `FREE` status
   - Creates ticket with `PENDING_APPROVAL` status
   - Sends notifications to user and admin

4. **Webhook Handler** (`tickets/views_webhook.py`)
   - `POST /api/stripe/webhook/` - Processes Stripe events
   - Handles `checkout.session.completed`:
     - Marks order as `PAID`
     - Creates tickets with `PENDING_APPROVAL` status
     - Sends notifications to user and admin
   - Handles `payment_intent.payment_failed`:
     - Marks order as `FAILED`
     - Notifies user

5. **Helper Endpoint** (`tickets/views_checkout.py`)
   - `GET /api/tickets/orders/by_session/` - Retrieves order by session ID
   - Used by success page to show order confirmation

6. **Serializer Updates** (`tickets/serializers.py`)
   - `MyTicketsListSerializer` - Enhanced to include:
     - `price`, `event_name`, `event_id`, `event_date`
     - `venue_name`, `qr_payload`, `approved_at`
     - All fields needed by frontend

7. **Settings Configuration** (`timely/settings.py`)
   - Added Stripe environment variables:
     - `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
     - `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
     - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`

8. **URL Routing** (`tickets/urls.py`, `api/urls.py`)
   - Added checkout routes
   - Added webhook route at `/api/stripe/webhook/`
   - Removed legacy/mock implementations

### Frontend (React/TypeScript)

1. **Checkout Page** (`features/tickets/Checkout.tsx`)
   - Uses real Stripe checkout with direct URL redirect
   - Handles free vs paid events seamlessly
   - Better error handling with specific messages
   - No mock mode - pure real implementation

2. **Success Page** (`features/tickets/CheckoutSuccess.tsx`) - NEW
   - Shows order confirmation after payment
   - Displays "Pending Approval" status
   - Shows order summary (ID, amount, quantity)
   - Links to My Tickets

3. **Cancel Page** (`features/tickets/CheckoutCancel.tsx`) - NEW
   - Friendly cancellation message
   - Allows retry with link back to checkout

4. **My Tickets Page** (`features/tickets/MyTickets.tsx`)
   - Shows approval status badges:
     - Yellow badge for `pending_approval`
     - Green badge for `approved`
     - Red badge for `rejected`
   - Shows "Admin review pending" message
   - Disables QR code/download until approved
   - Shows approval timestamp

5. **Profile Page** (`features/profile/Profile.tsx`)
   - Fixed `helpText` → `helperText` prop
   - Profile updates now work correctly

6. **Router** (`app/routes.tsx`)
   - Added `/tickets/checkout/success` route
   - Added `/tickets/checkout/cancel` route

### Removed Files (Clean Up)

- ❌ `tickets/views_ticketing.py` - Removed mock implementation
- ❌ `tickets/views_stripe.py` - Removed old Stripe integration
- ❌ `tickets/models_backup.py` - Removed backup file

## 🔑 Environment Variables

### Backend `.env`
```env
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_51RlSLk04uHP1v9oT...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_... (generated by Stripe CLI)
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51RlSLk04uHP1v9oT...
```

### Frontend `.env`
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_51RlSLk04uHP1v9oT...
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Development (Test Mode)

1. **Install Stripe CLI:**
   ```bash
   brew install stripe/stripe-cli/stripe
   ```

2. **Start Webhook Forwarding:**
   ```bash
   stripe listen --forward-to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/stripe/webhook/
   ```
   Copy the `whsec_...` secret to backend `.env`

3. **Use Test Cards:**
   - Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
   - Decline: `4000 0000 0000 0002`

### Complete Flow

**Paid Event:**
1. User clicks "Get Ticket" on paid event
2. Backend creates Stripe checkout session
3. User redirected to Stripe payment page
4. User completes payment
5. Stripe sends webhook → Backend creates tickets
6. User sees success page
7. Tickets appear in "My Tickets" with "Pending Approval"
8. Admin approves in Django Admin
9. User receives notification
10. Ticket shows "Approved" with QR code

**Free Event:**
1. User clicks "Get Ticket" on free event
2. Backend creates order and ticket immediately
3. User sees "Submitted for approval" message
4. Ticket appears in "My Tickets" with "Pending Approval"
5. Admin approves
6. Ticket shows "Approved"

## 🔧 Issues Fixed During Implementation

1. ✅ Migration conflict with `client_reference_id` unique constraint → Made nullable
2. ✅ Stripe key loading from settings → Changed to use `env()` function
3. ✅ Deprecated `redirectToCheckout()` → Use direct URL redirect
4. ✅ Missing `/api/tickets/free/` endpoint → Added to views_checkout.py
5. ✅ Profile update 500 error → Fixed bad import in api/views.py
6. ✅ React `helpText` prop warning → Changed to `helperText`
7. ✅ MyTickets serializer missing fields → Added price, event info, etc.
8. ✅ Pending orders without tickets → Created fix script and ran it

## 🔐 Security Notes

✅ Stripe keys stored in .env (gitignored)  
✅ Webhook signature verification implemented
