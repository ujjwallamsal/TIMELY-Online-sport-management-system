## üß™ Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required
- [ ] Test all navigation items based on user roles
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connection and reconnection
- [ ] Test offline/online detection
- [ ] Verify error boundary catches and displays errors properly
- [ ] Test responsive design on mobile/tablet
- [ ] Verify accessibility with screen reader
- [ ] Test form validation and error messages

### API Integration Testing
- [ ] Verify all endpoints return expected data
- [ ] Test authentication flows (login/logout/refresh)
- [ ] Verify role-based access control
- [ ] Test error handling for 401/403/404/500 responses
- [ ] Verify WebSocket message handling

### Performance Testing
- [ ] Test page load times
- [ ] Verify skeleton loading states
- [ ] Test image lazy loading
- [ ] Check bundle size and code splitting

## üêõ Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **News Endpoint**: News endpoints return 404 - may need backend implementation
2. **Gallery Endpoint**: Gallery endpoints return 404 - may need backend implementation
3. **Ticket System**: Ticket endpoints return 404 - backend implementation needed
4. **Notifications**: Notification endpoints return 404 - backend implementation needed

### Workarounds Implemented
- Home page gracefully handles missing news/gallery data with empty states
- Admin dashboard shows placeholder for ticket metrics
- Error handling provides user-friendly messages for missing features

## üìã Deployment Checklist

### Before Production
- [ ] Update environment variables for production API
- [ ] Test all API endpoints in production environment
- [ ] Verify WebSocket connection in production
- [ ] Test error reporting integration (if implemented)
- [ ] Verify all images and assets load correctly
- [ ] Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Test accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)

### Performance Optimization
- [ ] Enable code splitting for large bundles
- [ ] Implement image optimization
- [ ] Add service worker for offline functionality
- [ ] Optimize API calls with proper caching
- [ ] Minimize bundle size

## üîß Development Setup

### Required Environment Variables
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Available Scripts
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Build
npm run build

# Preview
npm run preview

# Lint
npm run lint

# Type check
npm run type-check
```

### Backend Dependencies
- Django backend running on http://localhost:8000
- WebSocket server for real-time updates
- All API endpoints properly configured

## üìù Notes

### Architecture Decisions
1. **State Management**: Using React Query for server state, React Context for client state
2. **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for consistency
3. **Real-time**: WebSocket with fallback to polling
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error boundaries and user-friendly messages
5. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA labels

### Future Enhancements
1. Add PWA capabilities
2. Implement advanced caching strategies
3. Add real-time collaboration features
4. Implement advanced analytics dashboard
5. Add multi-language support
6. Implement advanced notification preferences
