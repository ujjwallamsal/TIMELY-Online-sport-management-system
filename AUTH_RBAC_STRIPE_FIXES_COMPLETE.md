## Setup Instructions

### 1. Backend Setup

```bash
cd timely-backend

# Create .env file with Stripe keys
cat > .env << 'EOF'
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:5173

# Get these from https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET_HERE
EOF

# Install Stripe if not already installed
pip install stripe

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Start server
python manage.py runserver
```

### 2. Frontend Setup

```bash
cd timely-frontend

# Create .env file
cat > .env << 'EOF'
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_YOUR_KEY_HERE
EOF

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start dev server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Stripe Webhook Setup (Local Testing)

```bash
# Install Stripe CLI: https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli
stripe listen --forward-to http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/tickets/webhook

# This will give you a webhook secret starting with whsec_
# Add it to your backend .env as STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

### 4. Test Card Numbers

Use Stripe test cards for testing:
- **Success**: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- **Decline**: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- **Requires Auth**: `4000 0025 0000 3155`

Any future expiry date (e.g., 12/25) and any 3-digit CVC.

## Known Limitations

1. **Approval Required**: All tickets require admin/organizer approval after payment. This is intentional for event management.

2. **Mock Mode Fallback**: If Stripe keys are not configured, the system falls back to mock mode with clear labeling.

3. **Webhook Testing**: For local testing, you need Stripe CLI to forward webhooks. In production, configure the webhook URL in Stripe Dashboard.

4. **Email Notifications**: Currently using console email backend. Configure SMTP settings in `.env` for production emails.

## Support

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Cannot reach server" error on login
- **Fix**: Ensure backend is running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

**Issue**: Payment redirects to blank page
- **Fix**: Check `FRONTEND_URL` in backend `.env` matches your frontend URL

**Issue**: Webhook not processing
- **Fix**: Ensure Stripe CLI is running with `stripe listen --forward-to ...`

**Issue**: "Invalid signature" webhook error
- **Fix**: Update `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` in backend `.env` with secret from Stripe CLI
