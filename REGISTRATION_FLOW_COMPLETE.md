## ‚úÖ Backend Implementation

### 1. Registration Checkout Endpoint
**File:** `timely-backend/registrations/views_checkout.py`

- **POST `/api/registrations/checkout/`**
  - Accepts: `event_id`, `notes`
  - Validates athlete role and event availability
  - Handles three scenarios:
    - **Free events**: Creates registration immediately with status `PENDING` and payment_status `PAID`
    - **Mock mode**: For development when Stripe not configured
    - **Real Stripe**: Creates checkout session with proper metadata
  - Returns:
    - Free: `{mode: 'free', registration_id, message}`
    - Mock: `{mode: 'mock', registration_id, message}`
    - Stripe: `{sessionId, checkout_url, registration_id}`

- **GET `/api/registrations/success/`**
  - Returns registration details after successful payment

**Key Features:**
- Idempotency keys prevent duplicate charges
- Backend-authoritative pricing (never trusts client amounts)
- Proper error handling with detailed messages
- Metadata includes `type: 'registration'` to differentiate from tickets

### 2. Webhook Handler Updates
**File:** `timely-backend/tickets/webhooks.py`

- Added `handle_registration_payment()` function
- Processes `checkout.session.completed` events for registrations
- Updates registration payment status to `PAID`
- Logs payment in `RegistrationPaymentLog`
- Sends notifications to:
  - Athlete: "Payment successful - awaiting approval"
  - Organizer: "New paid registration received"
- Broadcasts realtime updates via WebSocket

### 3. Approval Actions
**File:** `timely-backend/registrations/views.py`

- **PATCH `/api/registrations/{id}/approve/`**
  - Validates organizer/admin permissions
  - Updates status to `APPROVED`
  - Creates notification with deep link to `/schedule`
  - Broadcasts status change

- **PATCH `/api/registrations/{id}/reject/`**
  - Validates organizer/admin permissions
  - Updates status to `REJECTED`
  - Requires reason for rejection
  - Creates notification with deep link to `/registrations/my`

**RBAC Enforcement:**
- Only event organizer or admin can approve/reject
- Clear error messages for permission denied

### 4. Profile Update Fix
**File:** `timely-backend/accounts/serializers.py` & `views.py`

- Expanded `UserProfileUpdateSerializer` to support:
  - `phone`, `date_of_birth`, `address`, `emergency_contact`, `bio`
- Updated `me` action to support PATCH/PUT methods
- Returns full profile after update
- Creates audit log for profile changes

### 5. Role Application Endpoints
**Files:** `timely-backend/accounts/views.py`

- **POST `/api/auth/apply-athlete/`**
- **POST `/api/auth/apply-coach/`**
- **POST `/api/auth/apply-organizer/`**
- All endpoints prevent duplicate pending applications
- Return proper error messages with validation

  - Stripe: Redirects to `checkout_url`
- Loading states and error handling
- Prevents duplicate submissions

### 2. My Registrations Page

- Empty states with helpful messages
- Live updates every 30 seconds

### 6. Profile Fixes
**File:** `timely-frontend/src/features/profile/Profile.tsx`

**Fixes:**
- Profile save now calls `/users/me/` with PATCH
- Supports all profile fields (phone, DOB, address, emergency contact)
- Better error handling with backend error messages
- Non-critical notification failures don't block save
- Role applications properly call backend endpoints:
  - Organizer: Sends `reason`, `organization_name`, `phone`
  - Athlete: Sends `reason`
- Loading states for role applications
- Prevents duplicate submissions
